## [1.15.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added & Changed
- **Group Category Routing System (v1.2)**:
  - Added `ClientGroup` model and `client_groups` database table storing `chat_id`, `group_name`, `category` (`'A'` or `'B'`), and timestamps.
  - Pre-loaded `ClientGroup` categories into RAM (`CLIENT_GROUPS_CACHE`) on bot startup during `post_init()`.
  - **Category A (Trusted Groups)**: Orders are forwarded directly to Loader Group (status `Pending`).
  - **Category B (Payment Required Groups)**: Orders are forwarded to private Payment Review Group (status `Pending Payment`).
  - **Payment Review Commands**:
    - `/paymentgroup`: Configures private Payment Review Group.
    - `/approve <order_id>`: Approves Category B order, updates status to `Approved`, and forwards original message to Loader Group.
    - `/reject <order_id>`: Rejects Category B order, updates status to `Rejected`.
  - **Category Commands**:
    - `/A`: Assigns group to Category A (`✅ This group has been assigned to Category A.`).
    - `/B`: Assigns group to Category B (`✅ This group has been assigned to Category B.`).
    - `/category`: Displays current category (`Current Category ... Group: ... Category: ...`).
    - `/removecategory`: Removes group category (`✅ Group category removed successfully.`).
  - Added structured logs: `[CATEGORY] Group assigned to Category A/B`, `[PAYMENT] Order #<id> routed to Payment Review Group`, `[PAYMENT] Order #<id> approved/rejected`.
